 <h4>CHORUS</h4> <pre> <p>Night has spread her pall once more,
                And the pris'ner still is free:
           Open is his dungeon door,
                Useless now his dungeon key.
           He has shaken off his yoke—
                How, no mortal man can tell!
           Shame on loutish jailor-folk—
                Shame on sleepy sentinel!</p></pre>
